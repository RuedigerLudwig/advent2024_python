# Advent of Code 2024

Here are my solutions for [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024). Thanks to [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl) for the great puzzles and the great time I have solving them.

My goal is to solve each puzzle on the day it was posted. Also I want to create code that is correct (of course), but which I still understand in about a year. So a readable solution is preferable to one that is only correct. This is why I use TDD, classes and comments where they technically might not be necessary. I often refine my solution after I handed it in.

I use python 3.13 without any libraries beyond the standard.
